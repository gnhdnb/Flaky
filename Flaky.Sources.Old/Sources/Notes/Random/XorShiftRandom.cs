	/// <summary>
	/// A fast random number generator for .NET
	/// Colin Green, January 2005
	/// 
	/// Note. A forked version of this class exists in Math.Net at time of writing (XorShift class).
	/// 
	/// Key points:
	///  1) Based on a simple and fast xor-shift pseudo random number generator (RNG) specified in: 
	///  Marsaglia, George. (2003). Xorshift RNGs.
	///  http://www.jstatsoft.org/v08/i14/paper
	///  
	///  This particular implementation of xorshift has a period of 2^128-1. See the above paper to see
	///  how this can be easily extended if you need a longer period. At the time of writing I could find no 
	///  information on the period of System.Random for comparison.
	/// 
	///  2) Faster than System.Random. Up to 8x faster, depending on which methods are called.
	/// 
	///  3) Direct replacement for System.Random. This class implements all of the methods that System.Random 
	///  does plus some additional methods. The like named methods are functionally equivalent.
	///  
	///  4) Allows fast re-initialisation with a seed, unlike System.Random which accepts a seed at construction
	///  time which then executes a relatively expensive initialisation routine. This provides a vast speed improvement
	///  if you need to reset the pseudo-random number sequence many times, e.g. if you want to re-generate the same
	///  sequence of random numbers many times. An alternative might be to cache random numbers in an array, but that 
	///  approach is limited by memory capacity and the fact that you may also want a large number of different sequences 
	///  cached. Each sequence can be represented by a single seed value (int) when using FastRandom.
	/// </summary>
