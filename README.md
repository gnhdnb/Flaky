# Flaky

Flaky is C# generative music framework.

I'm using it:
- as a live coding framework for [my performances](https://soundcloud.com/monekeer/live-coding-equinox)
- as a DSP playground to test out various novel synthesis techniques (DNN vocal synthesis was used in [this performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg_7ZnIeaMo) for example)
- to study various ways of player interaction with in-game generative audio (the framework can be integrated into Unity runtime)
